# Project Overview

## Project Name
Hero-Villain- Uncovered.

## Project Description

I want users to be able to find information on any hero or villain of their choosing.

## API and Data Sample

I will be using "https://superheroapi.com/api" api for this project

"{
    "response": "success",
    "results-for": "thanos",
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "655",
            "name": "Thanos",
            "powerstats": {
                "intelligence": "100",
                "strength": "100",
                "speed": "33",
                "durability": "100",
                "power": "100",
                "combat": "80"
            },
            "biography": {
                "full-name": "Thanos",
                "alter-egos": "No alter egos found.",
                "aliases": [
                    "The Mad Titan",
                    "Masterlord",
                    "The Overmaster",
                    "Chins"
                ],"

## Wireframes
I created 1 wireframe, overall I want the image and information stored to be centered "https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/5e03e5ec8441974".

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Users to able to find any villain or hero of their choosing
- Able to interact with image

#### PostMVP  

- Background img changes with different publisher name

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|May 14-16| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|May 17| Project Approval / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|May 18| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|May 19| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|May 20| MVP | Incomplete
|May 21| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
